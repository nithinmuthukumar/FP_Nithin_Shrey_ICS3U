After fighting a fearsome battle,
and losing many of your friends,
you decide to return home,
and play a rip-off Legend of Zelda game.

That's all the exposition you get.
No, Really.

Oh, yeah.
Here's some tips to help you win:

If you die alot,
just,
don't.

For sir: If you want to explore
the map and not die immediately,
set link.health+=1 
in the main loop.

The shop is roughly in the middle
of the map, beneath the Castle.
Hit the old lady to open the shop.

You need 8 keys to get into the
castle and defeat the boss
(you can get around this by changing the number of keys you
have in the code). If you buy
the minimap in the shop, you
can see the Crosses on the minimap
which indicate where the keys are.
Remember -- There are areas other
than where you start. To get the
rest of the keys, you need to make
your way to the top-left bridge
and cross it to get into the
Lost Woods. That's where the
remaining keys are.

Also -- Remember to save in the
options menu.
Look at the instructions page
to see how to access the options
menu.
